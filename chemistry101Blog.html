Chemistry 101 - a Chemistry Quiz about Elements (in AIR [Flex-based])<p>

This Chemistry 101 application is an example combining some easy Flex techniques (using some custom AS3 classes to represent the Periodic Table of Elements, playing a dynamic MP3 (of the pronunciation of each element), using a custom preloader, and managing the content display based on Internet connectivity), as well as a ColdFusion CFC function that uses the CFHTTP tag to screen-scrape element details. Atomic Numbers, Groups and Periods, Oh My!

Feel free to use this application as a study-tool to test your knowledge of the chemical elements.

Some interesting things I explored during this project:<br>
<ul>
<li>Creating classes - an Element AS3 class and a Symbol AS3 class.</li>
<li>Dynamically loading and playing MP3 sounds, based on the element displayed.</li>
<li>Managing the content based on Internet connectivity.</li>
<li>Working with the Math functions in AS 3 is cool.</li>
</ul>
